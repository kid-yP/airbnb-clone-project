- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma (for UI/UX mockups)

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Implement responsive and intuitive UI/UX designs
- Structure a scalable full-stack web application
- Practice collaborative development using Git
- Build reusable UI components
- Apply best practices for frontend/backend integration

📐 UI/UX Design Planning
Design Goals
Create an intuitive and smooth booking flow
Maintain visual consistency across pages
Optimize for fast loading and performance
Prioritize mobile responsiveness

Key Features
Property search with dynamic filtering
View complete property details with photos and descriptions
Secure and seamless checkout process

Primary Pages
You can add this table to describe the pages:

Page	Description
Property Listing View	A grid of available properties, searchable and filterable by price, location, rating, etc.
Listing Detailed View	A full page showing property details, images, user reviews, and a booking form.
Simple Checkout View	A streamlined page for entering payment info and confirming a booking.

Color Styles
Create a bullet list like this:

Primary: #FF5A5F

Secondary: #008489

Background: #FFFFFF

Text: #222222

Secondary Text: #717171

Typography
You can format it in a neat list:

Primary Font: Circular

Weight: Medium (500)

Size: 16px

Headings: Circular

Weight: Bold (700)

Size Range: 24px–32px

Secondary Text: Circular

Weight: Book (400)

Size: 14px

🧩 Why This Matters
Below that, add a paragraph like this:

>Understanding the design properties from Figma is crucial for implementing a consistent and polished UI. Identifying styles such as colors and typography ensures that the frontend mirrors the design accurately, streamlines teamwork, and improves both aesthetics and usability. It also helps when building reusable components later in the development process.

🧠 Why User-Friendly Design Matters
A well-designed interface enhances the overall experience. For a booking platform:
It reduces frustration and drop-offs during checkout
Builds trust through clean visuals and clear navigation
Encourages more conversions and repeat users
