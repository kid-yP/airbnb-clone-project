🧩 Why This Matters
> Understanding the design properties from Figma is crucial for implementing a consistent and polished UI. Identifying styles such as colors and typography ensures that the frontend mirrors the design accurately, streamlines teamwork, and improves both aesthetics and usability. It also helps when building reusable components later in the development process.

🧠 Why User-Friendly Design Matters
A well-designed interface enhances the overall experience. For a booking platform:

It reduces frustration and drop-offs during checkout

Builds trust through clean visuals and clear navigation

Encourages more conversions and repeat users
